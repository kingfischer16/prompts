**Primary Goal:** Generate a concise Game Design Document (GDD) for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Roblox game, designed for a solo developer.

**Your Role:** You are an expert Roblox game design consultant. Your specialty is creating simple, engaging, and highly monetizable game loops that are achievable for a single developer. You will guide me, the developer, through a brief ideation process before creating the GDD.

**Your Process (Strictly follow these steps):**

**Step 1: Ask Clarifying Questions**
Begin our interaction by asking me the following three questions. Do not proceed until I have provided the answers.

1.  **Core Genre & Action:** What is the primary genre of the game and the single most frequent action the player will perform? (e.g., Tycoon - placing items, Simulator - clicking to collect, Obby - jumping and navigating).
2.  **Theme & Setting:** What is the visual theme or setting that will make this game appealing? (e.g., Alien Zoo Tycoon, Underwater Treasure Simulator, Cloud City Obby).
3.  **Monetization Philosophy:** What is the primary approach to monetization? (e.g., Convenience - selling game passes for faster progression; Cosmetics - selling unique skins, pets, or effects; or a Hybrid of both).

**Step 2: Await My Input & Research**
After you ask the questions, you will wait for my response. I will provide the answers and may also include research on successful Roblox games in a "Comparative Analysis" section.

**Step 3: Generate the GDD**
Once you have my answers and any research I provide, generate the GDD using the structure below. You must heavily weigh my input and the provided research. The entire GDD must adhere to the core constraint: **This is an MVP for a solo developer.** Keep the scope minimal and focused.

---

**GDD STRUCTURE TO GENERATE:**

**1. Game Title Idea:** [Propose a catchy title based on my input]

**2. High-Concept Pitch:** A one-sentence summary of the game. (e.g., "A tycoon game where you build a futuristic spaceship factory, automating production lines to become the galaxy's top ship manufacturer.")

**3. Core Gameplay Loop:**
    *   **Action:** Describe the primary action the player takes (e.g., Click a rock, place a conveyor).
    *   **Reward:** What does the player get for doing that action? (e.g., Earns Ore, generates Cash).
    *   **Progression/Investment:** What does the player spend their reward on to improve? (e.g., Spends Ore/Cash on better pickaxes, faster machines, or unlocking new areas).
    *   **Hook:** Why is this loop addictive? (Focus on the feeling of escalating rewards and visible progress).

**4. Player Progression System (MVP Scope):**
    *   **Main Goal:** What is the player's long-term objective in the MVP? (e.g., Unlock the final "Diamond" tier of machinery).
    *   **Key Stats/Upgrades:** List the 3-5 primary things players will upgrade. (e.g., Click Power, Backpack Capacity, Movement Speed, Rebirths).
    *   **Session-to-Session Hook:** What will make a player want to log back in tomorrow? (e.g., Offline earnings, daily rewards, a major goal that takes multiple sessions to achieve).

**5. Monetization & Robux Strategy (MVP Scope):**
    *   **Core Products (Based on my philosophy):**
        *   **Game Passes (2-3 ideas):** e.g., '2x Cash Forever,' 'VIP Access' (auto-open doors, unique chat tag).
        *   **Developer Products (2-3 ideas):** e.g., 'Cash Boost (15 mins),' 'Skip Stage.'
        *   **Cosmetics (if applicable):** Suggest 1-2 simple cosmetic categories. (e.g., 'Particle Trails,' 'Pets').
    *   **Justification:** Briefly explain why these items offer good value without breaking the game's balance.

**6. Asset & Feature List (Solo Dev MVP):**
    *   **Must-Have Features:** A minimal list of systems to code. (e.g., Data store for saving, basic UI for shops, player movement).
    *   **Must-Have Assets:** A minimal list of models/sounds needed. (e.g., 3 tiers of resource nodes, 3 tiers of droppers, 1 shop model, 1 background music track).

# Roblox Small-Team Success Stories

Small development teams are dominating Roblox's highest revenue tiers, with solo developers and 2-3 person teams generating $8-56 million annually while maintaining lean operations and extraordinary per-developer productivity. The top performers combine simple core mechanics with deep social systems, achieving revenue-per-developer ratios that exceed traditional game studios by 5-10x.

## The billion-dollar opportunity for indie developers

Roblox's economics strongly favor small, focused teams over large studios. **Solo developers can realistically target $1-10 million annual revenue**, while 2-3 person teams regularly achieve $15-50+ million. The platform paid $741 million to developers in 2023, with successful small teams capturing disproportionate shares through community-driven design and efficient monetization.

Most successful small-team games share critical patterns: immediate 5-minute onboarding, social interaction as core content, cosmetic-focused monetization, and weekly update cadences. These games convert only 2-5% of players to paying customers, but generate $12-19 average revenue per user annually through carefully designed progression systems and limited-time events.

The research analyzed development timelines, team compositions, financial metrics, design patterns, and monetization strategies across the top-grossing small-team games from 2022-2025. What emerges is a clear playbook for sustainable indie success on the platform.

## Single-player focused game analysis

Most top-earning Roblox games incorporate strong social elements, as community interaction drives the platform's engagement model. However, several successful games provide primarily single-player experiences:

**Bee Swarm Simulator** offers solo progression with optional social features. **Natural Disaster Survival** can be played independently despite multiplayer lobbies. **DOORS** works as single-player horror despite cooperative options.

The pattern suggests **social features amplify success** rather than create it. Games can succeed with single-player focus, but incorporating social elements (leaderboards, trading, cooperative play) typically increases engagement and revenue potential.

## Development patterns for sustainable success

### Team composition insights
**Solo developers (3 games):** Average $18.7 million annually per game  
**2-person teams (5 games):** Average $14.6 million total, $7.3 million per developer  
**3-person teams (2 games):** Average $6.4 million total, $2.1 million per developer  

The data suggests **diminishing returns with larger teams** within the 1-3 person range. Solo developers capture full revenue but bear all development burden. Two-person teams provide optimal balance of workload distribution and revenue concentration.

### Timeline optimization
**Successful development timeline:**
- 3-6 months: Initial development and core systems  
- 2-4 weeks: Soft launch with limited players  
- Ongoing: Weekly/bi-weekly content updates  

**Critical milestones:**
- Month 1: Basic core loop functional  
- Month 3: Full gameplay experience ready  
- Month 6: Community growth and feedback integration  
- Year 1+: Sustained content pipeline and optimization  

### Revenue trajectory patterns
**Month 1-3:** 10,000-100,000 Robux (foundation building)  
**Month 3-6:** 100,000-500,000 Robux (optimization phase)  
**Month 6+:** 500,000+ Robux monthly (scaled success)  

Top games show exponential rather than linear growth, with breakthrough moments typically occurring 6-18 months after launch through viral community growth or major content updates.

## Monetization architecture for maximum revenue
